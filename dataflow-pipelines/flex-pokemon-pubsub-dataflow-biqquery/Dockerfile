# Because this image will be used as custom sdk container image, and it already 
# installs the dependencies from the requirements.txt, we can omit
# the FLEX_TEMPLATE_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_FILE directive here
# to reduce pipeline submission time.
# Similarly, since we already installed the pipeline package,
# we don't have to specify the FLEX_TEMPLATE_PYTHON_SETUP_FILE="${WORKDIR}/setup.py" configuration option.

# A conflict may or may not be significant for your pipeline.
